     if we want to create array, we use -> [] brackets and put a list of
     values inside, separated each value with coma. we can also wright array
     in multiple lines. 
     to get a value inside the array, we use square brackets --> [],
     and a number inside, like 1 - this number is called INDEX and represents the position in the array. 
     inside the array we can put any tyoe of value. Array itself is also a value, which means that we can save arrays in variables 
     or even save it in array. an array is an object but special type  of it */

    we can use this code above. arrays has properties and functions to use.  */

    console.log(myArray.length);   
    /* the function, which is mentioned as --> .length,
    tells us how many objects are inside the array. so we receive 3 in this situation,
    because if we see above, we can count that there is 3 objects inside the array.
    
    next is --> .push() and it adds a value to the end of the array. 

    .splice() --> removes a value from an array. the first number we give to it is 
    index number, and the second is the quantity of the values we want to remove. */

    /* another feature of JS is loops- it lets us run some code 
    over and over.  */

                          the code inside () is called loop condition, and inside {} is called loop body.
                          variable i from the top is called loop variable. everytime we loop, we increase loop variable by 1, this is called INCREMENT STEP.
                          replaying the loop is called iteration, and we did iteration 5 times in this code. loops create scope, which means that,
                          everythng we create inside {} will stay inside it.*/

           if we use standart loops, it is recomnded to use FOR - loop, which contains 3 types of element in it,
           if we need non-standart loops, we use while loops. non standart example is below...*/
